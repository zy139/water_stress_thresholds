(1) The retrieved VPD spanning from 2001 to 2020 are available in "01 VPD" folder.


(2) The spatial explicit distribution of SM thresholds (with significance) are available in "02 SM thresholds" folder.


(3) The spatial explicit distribution of VPD thresholds (with significance) are available in "03 VPD thresholds" folder.


(4) The pixel-level changes in grassland EOS sensitivity to SM (and VPD) between below-threshold and above-threshold conditions are available in "04 changes in sensitivity" folder.
